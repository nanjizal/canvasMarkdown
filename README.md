# canvasMarkdown
'canvasMarkdown' helps display Markdown on Canvas via ForeignObject, uses haxe, it's not feasible to view the result with github raw but below is how the Markdown is rendered on the canvas with the transform we applied.  It may not be easy/possible/practical to display images within the Markdown, but base64 encoded may work there are ForeignObject security limitations.
